￼PROBLEM
In India , there are almost 10 metropolitans and 150 cities in which each one encounters with almost hundreds of different events every month. The problem is, it doesn’t reach to the right and the most needed ears. Event organizers are being forced to publish their events through ads in the newspaper. As a result, either organizer publishes ads in all newspaper or everyone reads the same newspaper. So the volume of targets gets absolutely very minimum. On an average only 10 out of every 100 gets to know about the happenings. A developer misses hackathon , business men misses conferences, students misses events, as a whole the response to an event is just 1/10 .
PROPOSED SOLUTION
To overcome the above mentioned problem , I thought of developing a constructive platform which allows any users to search for events respective to the categories such as College, Business, Sports, Festival, Events. It gives all the necessary information to users. Users can also request for a post . All requested posts will be active on application only upon manual verification(website check, manual phone call) to avoid fake requests. Additionally , users can also share a particular events with their friends. Users will be notified for any popular events. Almost 200 cities in India are covered. As an outcome, organizers gets the right response. The impact of any event increases significantly.
